# 🎬 Movie Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a movie dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights using **Python**.  
The focus is on **data cleaning, preprocessing, genre analysis, and visualization** to support data-driven decision making.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw movie data  
- Convert release dates to proper datetime format  
- Handle duplicate records and irrelevant columns  
- Analyze movie genres (including multi-genre handling)  
- Perform statistical analysis  
- Visualize data to extract meaningful insights  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about movies, including:
- Release date  
- Title  
- Popularity  
- Vote count  
- Vote average  
- Genres  
- Original language  

*Note: Genres are comma-separated values, requiring preprocessing before analysis.*

---

## 🔄 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Converted `release_date` from string to datetime format  
- Extracted release year for time-based analysis  
- Removed duplicate rows  
- Dropped unnecessary columns  
- Validated data types and missing values  

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key analysis steps:
- Distribution of movie genres  
- Statistical summary of popularity and ratings  
- Identification of most frequent genres  
- Visualization of genre distribution  

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- **Drama** is the most frequent genre in the dataset  
- Multi-genre movies are common and need proper splitting  
- Popularity and vote counts vary significantly across genres  

---

## 📉 Visualizations
- Bar chart showing genre distribution  
- Statistical plots to understand ratings and popularity trends  

---

## 🚀 Learnings
- Hands-on experience with real-world data cleaning  
- Reminder that data preprocessing is crucial before analysis  
- Improved ability to convert business questions into analytical steps  

---

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Sentiment analysis on movie descriptions  
- Time-series analysis on movie releases  
- Dashboard creation using Power BI or Tableau
